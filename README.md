# ‚öîÔ∏è PW.Ability

**PW.Ability** is a modular Unreal Engine 5 framework providing base classes and utilities for spawning and managing gameplay ability actors such as projectiles and effect actors.

Originally developed as part of **ProjectW**, it is now refactored into a standalone, **GAS-independent** module that integrates seamlessly with other PW systems.

---

## üß© Overview

**PW.Ability** provides a consistent foundation for ability-driven gameplay with a focus on clarity, extensibility, and modularity.

- Base actor classes for spell and projectile behavior  
  `AWBaseSpellActor`, `ABaseProjectile`, `ASplineMovementProjectile`, `AMyEffectActor`
- Custom components for movement and VFX handling  
  `USphereNiagaraComponent`, `UWProjectileMovementComponent`
- Optional team-aware targeting when `PW.Teams` is available (`WITH_PWTEAMS`)
- Shared runtime data through `USpellParamsBase` (from `PW.SharedTypes`)
- Fully extensible structure allowing projects to subclass parameters or behaviors

## üß± Module Dependencies

| Type | Dependencies |
|------|---------------|
| **Public** | Core, PWSharedTypes |
| **Private** | CoreUObject, Engine, Slate, SlateCore, Niagara, PWContracts |
| **Optional** | PWTeams *(auto-detected via WITH_PWTEAMS define)* |

PWAbility automatically detects the presence of **PW.Teams** at build time.  
If found, it enables `WITH_PWTEAMS=1` and adds the module dependency.  
Otherwise, it compiles standalone with `WITH_PWTEAMS=0`.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **SpellParams-driven logic** ‚Äî every spawned ability carries a context container derived from `USpellParamsBase`, ensuring consistent and network-safe data passing.
- **Team-aware filtering** ‚Äî functions like `IsEnemy`, `IsAlly`, and `CheckForCollisionTarget()` adapt based on `WITH_PWTEAMS`.
- **Extensible API** ‚Äî new actor types or parameter sets can be introduced without modifying the core module.
